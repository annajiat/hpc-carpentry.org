Together with CodeRefinery ([1]), we helped to organise
a variant of an instructor training workshop for the
EU HPC Centres of Excellence ([2]). We discussed lesson
design a number of times and there were a few interesting
things we realised during the workshop.

For me (Alan), I realised that I had never really considered Bloom's taxonomy
beyond an abstract sense. When it was time to leverage it during one of the exercises
to set lesson objectives, I struggled to apply it in a practical way. It raised
questions for me about what level(s) of the taxonomy we are supposed to target
in lesson episodes. After the workshop, and for this blogpost, I read up on this
a little and came across a post from the University of Arkansas ([3])
that helped me to grasp the key points in the use of the taxonomy:
* You set Lesson Objectives for the overall lesson that target a particular level of
  the taxonomy. For HPC Carpentry, this is most likely the "Applying" level.
* In your lesson episodes you should follow the principle (trivially adapted from ([3]))
  > Use Bloom’s Taxonomy to make sure that the verbs you choose for your (episode)
  > level objectives build up to the level of the verb that is in the (lesson) level
  > objective. The (episode) level verbs can be below or equal to the (lesson) level
  > verb, but they CANNOT be higher in level. For example, your (lesson) level verb
  > might be an Applying level verb, "illustrate." Your (episode) level verbs can be
  > from any Bloom’s level that is equal or below this level (applying,
  > understanding, or remembering).
